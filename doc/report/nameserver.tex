\chapter{Nameserver}

\begin{itemize}
    \item implemented multi hop over init (URPC was not mature enough + is extra challenge)
    \item Init route messages based on did and channels (if msg comes from client chan it gets rerouted to server chan of other domain)
    \item every domain has two channels (only one handler per channel per domain)
    \item one channel is used if domain acts as client (can block)
    \item the other channel is used if domain acts as server (handler was registered)  
\end{itemize}
