\chapter{Multicore}

Nowadays one can hardly find any single-core machine on the market, so
a modern operating system has to support multiple cores somehow. The 
Toradex board has not only four Cortex-A35 cores in the main processor 
cluster but also two Cortex-M4 processors which are used for real-time 
processing and chip-management. A heterogeneous multi-core system like
the Toradex board poses entirely new challenges on operating systems 
which were initially designed to support machines with just one single-core 
processor.

Luckily for us Barrelfish was designed for heterogeneous systems from the
ground up and solved many of the occurring problems in an elegant but also
radical way. Our task in this milestone was to bring up the second core
and do all the preparation so Barrelfish can simply power on the second core
and jump to an address we provided earlier.
